    <h3>This Pasta Pomodoro Recipe is easy to make</h3>
    <p> Nothing says “baby’s first kitchen” quite like mediocre store-bought marinara sauce dumped over clumpy noodles—but nothing says “hello I am a confident, resourceful, worldly home cook” like a tangle of perfectly-cooked spaghetti cradling a rich, buttery, almost-as-easy-to-make-as-opening-a-can pomodoro sauce.</p>

    <h4>Ingridients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Tbsp. kosher salt, plus more</li>
        <li>28-oz. can whole peeled tomatoes</li>
        <li>garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, plus more</li>
        <li>basil sprigs, plus leaves for serving</li>
        <li>1 lb. spaghetti</li>
        <li>4½oz. Parmesan, finely grated, divided (about 1 cup)</li>
        <li>2Tbsp. unsalted butter</li>
    
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>While spaghetti is traditional in this dish, other long types of pasta can be used such as fettuccine, bucatini or angel hair pasta.</li>
        <li>Freshly grated parmesan cheese works best in this dish. Pre-grated cheese often contains stabilizers and anti caking agents and does not melt as well.</li>
        <li>You can make the sauce up to 2 days in advance, then reheat the sauce in a pan and toss the pasta, butter and parmesan cheese in the sauce right before serving. You can freeze the sauce for up to 2 months.</li>
        <li>You don’t need to wait for ripe summer tomatoes to enjoy pasta pomodoro. Make this sauce year round with high quality canned tomatoes. The secret ingredient for a great sauce is a can of San Marzano whole tomatoes. These plum tomatoes are sweet and mild, and they are the perfect foundation for pomodoro sauce. San Marzano tomatoes can be found in any grocery store under a variety of labels.</li>
    </ol>
